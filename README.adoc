## Palindrome Service

The Palindrome Service is a simple REST servce that performs CRUD operations on messages delivered through REST calls. You can create messages, update them, delete them and get them all. The message queue size is 50. This value is hardcoded. If the total is exceeded, the first message queue item is removed and the new one is added at the end.

#### How to run the service

###### Requirements:

- WildFly v11

You can download WildFly here: http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/12.0.0.Final/wildfly-12.0.0.Final.zip

Firstly, you will need to use Maven to build the target WAR file that is generated from the code. This should produce a WAR file called *palindrome-service.war*. Start the WildFly server and add an admin user as per the WildFly documentation. Navigate to http://localhost:9990 and click *Deployments* at the top of the WildFly manager. From here you can deploy the WAR file generated earlier. 


#### How to make API calls

###### GET  Get all of the Messages
The following command will list the user messages
```
curl  http://localhost:8080/palindrome-service/messages/ 
```
Example Output:
```
Messages:
1. racecar
2. 123321
```


###### POST 
**Create A Message**
Adds a message to the queue using the form parameter *message*. If the message is not a palindrome, it will not be added. An error will be returned. 
```
curl -X POST -d "message=racecar"  http://localhost:8080/palindrome-service/messages/
```
Example Output:
```
Palindrome [123321] added to messages.
```


###### POST 
**Update a message**
Updates the message provided in the path parameter with a form parameter called *updatedMessage*. An error will be returned if the message is not a palindrome.
